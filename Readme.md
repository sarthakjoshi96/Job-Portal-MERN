## Stack used 
The backend and frontend both are in the single directory. The backend is set to run on port 8080 and frontend on 3000.
I have used MERN stack for this code. 

## How to run the code locally?
To run the code locally, you need to run the command : npm run both
on the root directory i.e.  ~/Beekin/JOB-PORTAL$
I have configured the above command to run both the backend and frontend scripts concurrently using single command.
You can also to use two separate terminals to run server (Backend) - npm run server
and to run client (Frontend), in directory client, run - npm start 


## API Documentation
I have maintained postman collection for APIs (shared invite as well) 
https://www.postman.com/gold-comet-990936/workspace/beekin-job-portal/collection/25193060-d964f653-fdcd-452c-9594-fa48f493d87f?action=share&creator=25193060

Note- Some of the APIs will require bearer token, so you can use login and signup apis to generate token and hit APIs
